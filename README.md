# Challenge 1: Tic Tac Toe

## Mission
Create an Object Oriented tic tac toe application using Ruby.

## Details
* Demonstrate an understanding of object oriented programming (S.O.L.I.D., inheritence, polymorphism, etc)
* You should be able to play against the computer.
* Explain your algorithm for win detection (do not just hard code winning patterns).
* You should be able to pick who is the computer player and who is the human player.
* The application should run in the terminal only (no web interface)
* The computer does not need to be smart. Randomly selecting an available space is fine.
* When the game is done, it should announce who the winner is and ask if you want to play again.
